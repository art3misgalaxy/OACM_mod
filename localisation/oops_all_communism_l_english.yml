They are the inevitable outcomes of material realities - the struggle to harness resources, the organization of labor, and the march of technological progress. To understand a society, one must first understand its fields and factories, its mines and markets, for these are the foundations upon which all else is built. Superstition, ideology, and even culture are but fleeting reflections of deeper economic currents. Those who master production master history itself..§!\n"

 ethic_fanatic_nullist:0 "Fanatic Nullist"

 ethic_fanatic_nullist_desc:0 "§LAlthough it hurts, we must grow up and put aside our outdated notions of morality. There is no "divine spark" granting special value to a living mind.

 ethic_fanatic_naturalist:0 "Fanatic Naturalist"

 ethic_fanatic_naturalist_desc:0 "§LThe purity of nature is sacred. Synthetic abominations, unchecked industrialization, and the defilement of worlds are crimes against existence itself. We are the keepers of life's sanctity - any who would corrupt it must be purged, by root and branch.!§!\n"

# Panopticist
