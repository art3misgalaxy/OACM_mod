This is a mod for the Paradox Interactive Game Stellaris.

If you so choose to download this file before I actually like...make it good, here is what you need to do.

1: Download the .zip file.

2: Extract the file.

3: Launch Stellaris.

4: Go to your Mod Library.

5: Click the "Upload Mod" button.

6: Click the "Create Mod" button.

7: Name the mod "Oops! All Communism"

8: Navigate to the Stellaris Mods folder (NOTE: This is different on every Operating System!).

9: Delete the mod folder, and replace with the one in the .zip file.

10: Don't forget to add it to a playset.

Final notes: This is still very much a work in progress and probably will be for a VERY long time. I have barely play-tested it and I have no idea if it'll work on your system. I also have no idea if there are any bugs so good luck.
